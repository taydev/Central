#central: a... virtual computer* within java

This is my contribution for Hacktoberfest 2019. My initial plans were for other people to join in and contribute, but... 
that ain't happening I don't think. Welp, it's open source software, right? And it's for a future project I hope to
 revive. Actually, it technically is the revival of that project. Just without the Discord.

##what is central?

central is a way of creating virtual "computers" within java. why do I quote "computers" or asterisk them? because
 they're not computers in a technical sense. they're just objects. they're more like just extremely complicated state
  machines.
  
  they're not even that complicated, the file system sucked though.
  
##what's the uses of central?

Well, it's mainly just for my usage. However, it can be used for other things of a similar context, I guess. Once 
it's finished (probably AFTER Hacktoberfest, however I'll continue working on it indefinitely), it'll have some sort
 of modular command system, maybe a developing language so you can write your own applications... there's a lot on
  the todo list.
  
  Basically, it's just a fancy way of making a state machine.
  
###To anyone looking at this repo:

- This is 100% a remake of "circl", an old project of mine that's essentially a hacknet clone within Discord.
- If you're wondering why commits are sparse yet filled with only core mechanics (for now): I wanted to get the core
 functionality done in my free time at college. That's why commits have been 100% core features and no testing.
 - The most recent branch, "testing", is just for cleanup and making sure things work. Basically an *aesthetic* branch.


Thanks for stopping by! :heart:
