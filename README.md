# PROJECT NO LONGER MAINTAINED - WILL BE ARCHIVED

Sorry to everyone who wanted this. I might bring it back again in future, but at the moment I'm struggling to find motivation to work on it (and also a lack of room for implementing new features, since I've lost a lot of the original ideas).

-------------------------------------------------------

# Central: A virtual computer¹ system/network in Java

Central is a virtual system library written in Java. Originally planned to be used in my Discord bot based OS (Operating System)¹, it's essentially just... a way of virtualising a network of devices in Java. It's a weird concept I made up and I've wanted to be able to execute it for a few years now, but demotivation keeps getting to me whenever I work on it, so I often postpone any updates/commits.

## What is it used for?

As I said before, it was previously just designed to be used in my Discord bot "circl" as a way of creating an Operating System¹. I wanted to create a Hacknet-esque game of sorts, where users could interface with their own virtual computers via a CLI created in Discord, which could then be interacted with by any of the players in multiple ways. It was going to include things like cryptocurrency wallets, a trading market, full CLI command support, interactions between computers, etc. At the moment, it's just a network... but I plan to develop it in future.

I rebooted it in October 2019 as a Hacktoberfest contribution, but I plan on updating it soon™ and adding in the rest of the features I wanted, like protocol support and better interaction between devices.

## Contributions?

Not for the foreseeable future, no. The reason this project was never completed was due to it originally being a group project that was taken over by the person I used to work with on circl. I don't think I'd be comfortable with accepting other people's work onto it, as I want it to be a personal project.
